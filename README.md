# Vaccination model and data evaluation

This repository contains almost everything regarding the vaccination model:

1. The netlogo model itself
2. The jupyter notebook that contains the data exploration
3. All plots as images
4. The final presentation

The raw data (experiment-data-11000.csv) is not included as it exceeds the file size limit of GitHub.
